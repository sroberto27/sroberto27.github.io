      "Soil is the living foundation of agriculture; a dynamic system " +
      "shaped by climate, parent material, organisms, and time. This " +
      "course builds the conceptual and practical skills needed to read " +
      "a field, diagnose its constraints, and design nutrient programs " +
      "that sustain yield while protecting soil and water quality. " +
      "Through immersive case fields, lab simulations, and decision " +

      "in-season fertility decisions and 4Rs stewardship.",
    overview:
      "Beginning with soil-forming processes, horizon development, and " +
      "the physical and chemical properties that govern water, air, and " +
      "nutrient behavior, students learn to connect soil conditions to " +
      "crop response. The course then moves through the nitrogen cycle, " +
      "phosphorus and potassium dynamics, and the secondary and " +
      "micronutrients that shape plant health. Students develop fluency " +
      "with the diagnostic toolkit of modern agronomy: soil sampling " +
      "protocols, lab extractants, tissue analysis, and soil health " +
      "indices, and learn to translate test results into site-specific " +
      "nutrient plans across diverse cropping systems and fields.",
