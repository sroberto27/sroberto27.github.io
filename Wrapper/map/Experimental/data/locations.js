   Loaded via <script>, like the other data/*.js files. Writes
   onto window.CAMPUS_CONFIG so app.js can keep reading these
   maps from `config.descriptionMap`, `config.imageMap`, etc.
   without any changes.

   Each map is keyed case-insensitively by the feature `name`
   from the GeoJSON data. This file is the place to edit the
   human-readable copy: descriptions, hero images, the
   "What happens here?" pill chips, the "Explorable locations"
   list, and the department category labels.

   Structural settings (map tiles, Treedis SDK plumbing,
   Leaflet styles, UI flags) live in config.js.
